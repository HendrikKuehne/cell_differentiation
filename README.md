# Summary
This code simulates the cell differentiation model introduced in "Oscillatory Protein Expression Dynamics Endows Stem Cells with Robust Differentiation Potential" (Suzuki, Furusawa, Kaneko, PLoS One 6 (11): e 27232, 2011) by Narito Suzuki, Chikara Furusawa and Kunihiko Kaneko. Stem cells are modelled as having gene and protein expression levels whose change is governed by two coupled differential equations and the inter-cellular interaction through a medium. I implemented this as part of the lecture "Universal Biology", held by Professor Furusawa, at the University of Tokyo in the winter semester of 2022/23.

# Code Structure
The code carrying out the simulation is contained in ``simulation.cpp``, which links to the header files ``functions.h`` (containing the cell struct and functions implementing time evolution and mitosos) and ``infrastructure.h`` (containing output routines and operator overloads). The gene and protein expression timelines obtained through simulation are saved in text files. ``evaluation.ipynb`` creates plots and tests for differentiated cell types based on these results.
